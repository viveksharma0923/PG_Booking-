Description of the Project
The Smart PG Management System is a database-driven application designed to streamline the process of PG room booking and management. It manages user registration, room allocation, booking records, and complaint management through a structured MySQL database, replacing manual methods that are error-prone and inefficient.

The project focuses on a normalized relational schema with core tables such as Users, Rooms, Bookings, and Complaints, along with appropriate relationships to maintain data consistency and reduce redundancy. It supports adding, updating, deleting, and searching records, making the system scalable and robust for real-world PG accommodation needs.

The backend database is implemented using MySQL with normalized tables to ensure efficient storage and quick data retrieval. The repository contains the ERD, DFD, schema design, and SQL scripts that form the backbone of the system.
